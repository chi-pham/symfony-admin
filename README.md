This installation guide expects that you're using docker-compose.

### 1. Clone repository

* manager-wait-for-it: Pure [bash script](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) to test and wait on the availability of a TCP host and port
* mailer: [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) Web and API based SMTP testing

### 3. Start containers

For this just run following command:

```bash
make up
```

### 4. Using application

You can sign in with credentials: login: `admin@test.app`, password: `123456`

### 5. Stop application
For this just run following command:

```bash
